## What I Find Interesting
This article demonstrates just how pervasive software is in our world. As cars become more tech-enabled, the appropriate software needs to be developed to ensure systems and processes run reliably. Software is also a way for car brands to differentiate themselves as other automotive specs are levelling-out between brands. That being said, this article discusses how much these automotive companies are investing in Gen-AI given how integrated software and software development is in their companies. They plan to utilize Gen-AI in their software development to increase productivity. However, despite the productivity gains that Gen-AI is capable of bringing, these companies are also challenged to enhance their software operating models. Specifically how "if an organization is underperforming in software development, gen AI alone is unlikely to resolve the issue."

I find it interesting how all sorts of companies, not just tech companies, need to establish a strong software development presence within the company.

## What [brian105](https://github.com/brian105) Found Interesting
I think that the application of Gen AI within the automotive world brings together the best of both AI and regular software engineering. The addition of a program which effectively can improve upon itself is a great help to the technological repertoire of a car, given that automotive softwares tend to take far longer to develop and require extensive testing. It can not only be implemented within the Software Engineering phase, but can also be used to (for example) detect malfunctions of the vehicle, aid in self-driving, and more.

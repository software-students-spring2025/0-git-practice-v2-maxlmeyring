## What I Find Interesting
This article demonstrates just how pervasive software is in our world. As cars become more tech-enabled, the appropriate software needs to be developed to ensure systems and processes run reliably. Software is also a way for car brands to differentiate themselves as other automotive specs are levelling-out between brands. That being said, this article discusses how much these automotive companies are investing in Gen-AI given how integrated software and software development is in their companies. They plan to utilize Gen-AI in their software development to increase productivity. However, despite the productivity gains that Gen-AI is capable of bringing, these companies are also challenged to enhance their software operating models. Specifically how "if an organization is underperforming in software development, gen AI alone is unlikely to resolve the issue."

I find it interesting how all sorts of companies, not just tech companies, need to establish a strong software development presence within the company.



- **[Nawab Mahmood Comment]**: I loved your point about how pervasive software development becoming and how it is no longer just a tech industry concern but a core function across industries like automotive. What stood out to me was the idea that AI alone won’t fix underlying inefficiencies in development models.  

  Its interesting to see how companies are investing heavily in AI to **boost productivity**, yet they still need to refine their **software operating models** to truly benefit. This reinforces the idea that **AI is a tool, not a replacement**—organizations still need strong development teams and structured processes to succeed.  

  The fact that software is now a **key differentiator for car brands** also shows how **the boundary between tech and traditional industries is blurring**. It makes me wonder how other non-tech industries will adapt their software strategies in the coming years.
